# chlorine.prelude

Chlorine prelude to compile core-cl2 strategies in advance.

## Usage

![Latest version](https://clojars.org/chlorine/prelude/latest-version.svg)

ChlorineJS supports Clojure macros so the compiler is way stateful.
This package provides some utility functions for compiling and saved states of
major Chlorine's core-cl2 strategies (bare, prod, prod-compat, dev).

This library is completely compiler-specific.
Please read the source code for details.
